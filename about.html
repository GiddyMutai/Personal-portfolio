    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>
        I am born and bred in Eldoret, Kenya. I schooled there for most of my early years, before
        going to high school in Western, Kenya. I went to the Friends School Kamusinga
        and upon graduation, I got admission to Kenyatta University.
        I've always had an interest in pursuing Software Engineering, and
        have ambitions of becoming a full-stack developer. I am always intrigued
        with the UI/UX of most applications and website interfaces, but at
        the same time interested in getting to know how all of that interacts
        at the back-end. Therefore, when the opportunity to join Moringa School
        presented itself, I took it, and I hope the journey will be worthwhile.
